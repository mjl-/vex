- automatically remove unreferenced blobs and manifests at least 24 hours past their modification.

- consider storing manifests explicitly (copied) for repos, not in global DBManifest that is referenced from DBRepoManifest. saves some indirections. manifests are small, so disk space is not an issue.
- structured logging with slog
- figure out how to have a public /v2/ that only requires authentication on push. returning 401 only for write operations, but not read operations, causes at least "docker push" to never do authentication (because /v2/ can be fetched without auth). with token-based authentication?
- add option to download an image, for import with "docker image load".
- signatures? is this still a think with docker schema v2?
- admin page, for managing users, removing tags, cleaning up unreferenced objects.
- possibly verify contents the uploaded blobs, as config and layer. and send content-type in responses.
